\chapter{The ESCRIBA project}

\ESCRIBA is just an efficient and automated \LaTeX project layout:

\begin{itemize}
  \item A project layout because it provides you with several directories
        for building documents making use of \LaTeX.
  \item It is automated, as it ships with a Makefile for cleaning, formatting,
        compiling and rendering your work.
  \item And finally, it is efficient because it saves you time!
\end{itemize}

When working with large academical works, it might be difficult to manage large
quantities of data and information. The only thing writer should care about is
writing. This is the main goal of \ESCRIBA.

In addition, this tool does not require from Ethernet access, meaning that you
can fully work locally and keep track of the changes by using a version control
system (VCS) such is \href{https://git-scm.com/}{Git}.

Finally, \ESCRIBA is an open-source software, released under
\href{https://github.com/jorgepiloto/escriba/blob/main/LICENSE}{Apache 2.0
  LICENSE}. This means that users are allowed to improve and contribute to the
project or even create a new one! The source code is hosted in
