\section{Available commands}

As introduced in previous section, the Makefile contains all the rules and
automation commands. Among these rules you can find:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{make clean}: this rule removes all the auxiliary files generated
	  by \LaTeX, so your project directory becomes clean.
  \item \textbf{make drawings}: this command will compile all the scripts stored
	  in the asy/ directory but will not remove those from the fig/ one.
  \item \textbf{make binaries}: this command will compile all the binaries
	  hosted in the bin/ folder.
  \item \textbf{make reformat}: by calling this rule, all your TeX files will be
	  reformatted according to the options defined in the
	  \$(LATEXINDENTOPTS) variable, which you can modify as you need.
  \item \textbf{make pdf}: the command use to compile and render the whole
	  project into a final PDF file.
\end{itemize}
